MegaLoader: A (hacked-together) Java class reloader.

I built this tool to reload a custom service running inside of an app server that doesn't support class reloading. It works great (for my team and myself). It was originally developed using JDK1.5 on Windows. I'm guessing it will work with JDK1.6+ on any platform, but this has not been tested.

To use:
Download javassist.jar and put it inside the .\lib directory off the root of this project.

Build using:
rake

MegaLoad.jar is created.

Add this to your call to java.exe:-noverify -javaagent:\path\to\megaload.jar
YOU MUST MODIFY reload.properties LOCATED INSIDE OF THE JAR!

The only properties available are:
reload.dir=C:\\myapp\\foo\\classes
# The root dir where the class files are kept inside your app server

reload.packages=foo.bar,foo.baz
# Only reload these packages. This isn't a regex (yet). 
# I'm just using String.startsWith for each package defined (split with a comma)

class.loader.suffix=GenericClassLoader
# Also doesn't use a regex (yet). For WebLogic, I'm using the GenericClassLoader suffix. 
# You may need to modify this depending on which app server you are using.
